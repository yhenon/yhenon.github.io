A patented crowd analysis system that measures audience engagement with digital displays. The technology uses multiple video detection methods to count viewers and track their attention, while accounting for accuracy by comparing results between different detection systems. It can determine both the number of people viewing content and how long they watch, automatically adjusting displayed content based on these metrics. This innovation helps optimize digital signage by providing real-time feedback on audience engagement and automated content selection.
