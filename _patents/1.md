A patented facial recognition system that intelligently selects the best frames from video footage for access control. The system processes multiple video frames of a person, scoring each frame based on factors like the number of people present, facial positioning, and image quality. By analyzing these scores, it chooses optimal frames to compare against an authorized database, making access control decisions more accurate and reliable. This approach helps overcome common challenges in facial recognition like poor image quality or non-ideal face angles.
