This research addresses bias in facial recognition technology by introducing a new dataset called "Balanced Faces in the Wild" (BFW). The study reveals that using a single threshold for face matching across all demographic groups leads to inconsistent performance. The researchers developed a new machine learning approach that improves overall accuracy while reducing demographic bias by removing demographic information from facial features. This work represents an important step toward making facial recognition systems more equitable across different ethnic and gender groups.
