We reveal critical insights into problems of bias in state-of-the-art facial recognition (FR) systems using a novel Balanced Faces in the Wild (BFW) dataset: data balanced for gender and ethnic groups. We show variations in the optimal scoring threshold for face-pairs across different subgroups. Thus, the conventional approach of learning a global threshold for all pairs results in performance gaps between subgroups. By learning subgroup-specific thresholds, we reduce performance gaps, and also show a notable boost in overall performance.
