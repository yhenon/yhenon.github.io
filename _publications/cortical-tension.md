This research focused on how mechanical forces guide the formation of the first internal cells in mouse embryos. The study shows that a protein called myosin II creates tension in cell membranes, causing specific cells to constrict and move inward. To measure this phenomenon in living mouse embryos, it was necessary to create a pipeline for instance segmentation and tracking of cells imaged using 4D two-photon microscopy.
