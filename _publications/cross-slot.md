This study explores using microfluidic devices to measure red blood cell elasticity. Using 3D simulations, we found that a cross-shaped channel design can effectively distinguish between healthy and diseased blood cells based on how they deform under flow. The research shows that cell position and orientation affect deformation patterns, and that this technique can reliably detect conditions like malaria with samples of just 50 cells. This method offers a potential new diagnostic tool for blood disorders that affect cell stiffness.
