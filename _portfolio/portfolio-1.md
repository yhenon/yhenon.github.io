As part of a three-person computer vision engineering team, I played a primary role in developing Wicket's facial recognition technology that achieved a Top 10 ranking in the prestigious NIST Facial Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT 1:1) in April 2022. My contributions to algorithm optimization and feature extraction techniques were instrumental in achieving this industry-recognized benchmark, positioning our solution among global leaders in biometric accuracy and performance. This accomplishment validated our technical approach and significantly enhanced the company's market position in the competitive facial recognition space.
